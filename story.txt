Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Reveille,

I am writing to you from a Malfunctioning spaceship in a Distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Purple rocket in August. There are 98 Aliens and Robots of origin here! In the
Blue Room there is a pool full of Coke. I fall asleep each night on a soft bed of
wood and dream of flying happily. It feels as though I have lived here for
20 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
Flying on a Powerful Acura RDX!!


Best wishes,
Kiran
